= How to contribute to the BioRuby project?

There are many possible ways to contribute to the BioRuby project,
such as

* Join the discussion on the BioRuby mailing list
* Send a bug report, write a bug fix patch
* Add and correcting documentations
* Development codes for new features etc.

and all of these are welcome!

However, here we describe on the last option -- how to contribute and
include your codes to the BioRuby distribution.

We would like to include your contribution as long as the scope of
your module meets the field of bioinformatics.

== Licence

If you wish your module to be included in the BioRuby distribution,
you need to agree that your module is licensed under the GNU's LGPL
as the BioRuby chosen LGPL for its license.

== Coding style

You need to follow the typical coding styles of the BioRuby modules:

=== Use the following naming conventions

* CamelCase for module and class names,
* '_'-separated lowercase names for method names,
* '_'-separated lowercase names for variable names, and
* all uppercase names for constants.

=== Indentation must not include tabs

* Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Don't replace spaces at the line head to tabs.

=== Comments

Don't use =begin and =end block for comments.  If you need to add
comments, include it in the RDoc documentation.

=== Each file must start with the following text

  #
  # = bio/db/hoge.rb - Hoge database parser
  #
  # Copyright::	Copyright (C) 2001, 2005
  #		Bio R. Hacker <brh@example.org>,
  #		Chem R. Hacker <crh@example.org>
  # Lisence::	LGPL

  #
  # == Blah blah blah
  #
  # See http://hoge.db/ for more details on the Hoge databse.
  # ... blah blah blah ...
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #   hoge = Bio::Hoge.new(entry)
  #   puts hoge.entry_id
  #   puts hoge.definition
  #
  # == References

=== Documentation should be written in the RDoc format in the source code

The RDoc format is becoming de facto standard for the Ruby documentation.
So, we are now in transition from the RD format which we have been used
to the RDoc format in API documentations.

Additional tutorial documents and some working examples are also
welcome when you contribute your codes.  You may also able to use
the header part of the file for this purpose as shown in the previous
section.

=== Testing code should use 'test/unit'

Unit test should come with your modules by which you can assure what
you meant to do with each method.  The test code is also able to make
your maintainance procedure easy and stable.

=== Using autoload

To make fast start up, we replaced most of 'require' to 'autoload'
since the BioRuby version 0.7.  During this change, we have found
some tips:

You sholud not separate a same namespace into several files.

* For example, if you have separated definitions of the Bio::Foo
  class in two files (e.g. 'bio/foo.rb' and 'bio/bar.rb'), you
  need to resolve the dependency of them (including the order of
  loading these two files) by yourself.

* It is not the case that you have a definition of Bio::Foo in
  'bio/foo.rb' and a definition of Bio::Foo::Bar in 'bio/bar.rb'.
  In this case, you just need to add following line in the
  'bio/foo.rb' file.

    autoload :Bar, 'bio/foo/bar'
    
You should not put several top level namespaces in one file.

* For example, if you have Bio::A, Bio::B and Bio::C in the file
  'bio/foo.rb', you need

    autoload :A, 'bio/foo'
    autoload :B, 'bio/foo'
    autoload :C, 'bio/foo'

  to load the module automatically (instead of require 'bio/foo').
  In this case, you should put them under the new namespace like
  Bio::Foo::A, Bio::Foo::B and Bio::Foo::C in the file 'bio/foo',
  then use

    autoload :Foo, 'bio/foo'

  to make autoload can be written in 1 line.

== Name space

Your module should be located under the module Bio and put under
the 'bioruby/lib/bio' directory.  The class/module names and the
file names should be short and descriptive.

There are already several sub directories in 'bioruby/lib':

  bio/*.rb   -- general and widely used basic classes
  bio/appl/  -- wrapper and parser for the external applications
  bio/data/  -- basic biological data
  bio/db/    -- flatfile database entry parsers
  bio/io/    -- I/O interfaces for files, RDB, web services etc.
  bio/util/  -- utilities and algorithms for bioinformatics

If your module doesn't match to any of the above, please propose
an appropriate directory name when you contribute.

== Maintainance

Finally, please keep maintain the code your contrubuted.  The BioRuby
staff is willing to give you CVS privilege if needed.
