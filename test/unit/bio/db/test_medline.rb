TI  - Agile methods in biomedical software development: a multi-site experience
      report.
PG  - 273
AB  - BACKGROUND: Agile is an iterative approach to software development that
      relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with dynamic
      environments. We have successfully used agile development approaches to
      create and maintain biomedical software, including software for
      bioinformatics. This paper reports on a qualitative study of our
      experiences using these methods. RESULTS: We have found that agile methods
      are well suited to the exploratory and iterative nature of scientific
      inquiry. They provide a robust framework for reproducing scientific
      results and for developing clinical support systems. The agile development
      approach also provides a model for collaboration between software
      engineers and researchers. We present our experience using agile
      methodologies in projects at six different biomedical software development
      organizations. The organizations include academic, commercial and
      government development teams, and included both bioinformatics and
      clinical support applications. We found that agile practices were a match
      for the needs of our biomedical projects and contributed to the success of
      our organizations. CONCLUSION: We found that the agile development
      approach was a good fit for our organizations, and that these practices
      should be applicable and valuable to other biomedical software development
      efforts. Although we found differences in how agile methods were used, we
      were also able to identify a set of core practices that were common to all
      of the groups, and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt these
      methods.
